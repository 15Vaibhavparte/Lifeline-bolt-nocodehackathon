# SUPABASE TIMEOUT ISSUE FIX

## Problem Summary
The application was experiencing timeout errors when loading blood drives due to:
1. Row Level Security (RLS) policies blocking anonymous access
2. Database tests running in production causing timeouts 
3. Inadequate error handling for Supabase query timeouts

## Errors Fixed
- "tried to subscribe multiple times" - notification subscription cleanup
- Query timeouts on blood_drives table access
- Hanging queries due to RLS policies

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Supabase Client Configuration (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- Added timeout wrapper utility function `withTimeout()`
- Enhanced error handling with better logging
- Added proper client configuration with headers

### 2. Improved Blood Drive Service (`src/services/bloodDriveService.ts`)
- Added timeout protection for queries (6 second limit)
- Implemented fallback to direct API calls when Supabase client fails
- Enhanced error handling with specific error types
- Added mock data fallback for development

### 3. Fixed Notification Service (`src/services/notificationService.ts`)
- Proper subscription cleanup to prevent "multiple subscription" errors
- Added retry mechanism for failed subscriptions
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### 4. Disabled Tests in Production (`src/pages/BloodDrives.tsx`)
- Database tests now only run in development mode
- Prevents timeout issues in production builds
- Maintains debugging capabilities for development

## Production Deployment Steps

### Option A: Quick Fix (Recommended)
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Disable RLS temporarily for blood_drives table
ALTER TABLE public.blood_drives DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT ON public.blood_drives TO anon;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO anon;
```

### Option B: Proper RLS Policy (Better Security)
```sql
-- Enable RLS and create proper policy
ALTER TABLE public.blood_drives ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for anonymous read access
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read access to blood drives" 
ON public.blood_drives 
FOR SELECT 
TO anon 
USING (true);

-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT ON public.blood_drives TO anon;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO anon;
```

## Testing

### Development Mode
- Database tests run automatically
- Full error logging enabled
- Timeout protection active

### Production Mode  
- Tests disabled to prevent timeouts
- Fallback mechanisms active
- Graceful error handling

## Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in Netlify:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Error Recovery
The application now automatically:
1. Tries Supabase client query first (with timeout)
2. Falls back to direct API call if client fails
3. Provides mock data if both methods fail
4. Logs detailed error information for debugging

## Monitoring
Check browser console for:
- `âœ… Successfully fetched blood drives:` (success)
- `ðŸš¨ Query timed out, trying direct API fallback...` (timeout recovery)
- `ðŸ“¡ Creating notification subscription...` (notification status)
